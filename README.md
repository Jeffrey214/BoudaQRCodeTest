# BoudaQRCodeTest

This is a simple program meant to be integrated with physical QR Codes within the Artillery Fortress Bouda
This program uses a html template with differant graphical elements, then using a simple python program content files are handled and integrated into the html environment as seperate display files.

At this current time this is a test a development build with all basic functions working, but it is far from complete.
